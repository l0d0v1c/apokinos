**Apokinos** is a lexikon for ancient greek based on Perseus in the shape of a single HTML5 page that can run online and offline.

# Purpose
Apokinos allows to search by latin alphabet. Some letters are transcribed as h for eta, w for omega, q for theta, f for phi,x for khi, y for psi.
It is designed to study ancient greek and quickly discover words.
The lexikon contains 36k+ lemmes.

# Bookmarking lemmes

On each words a &#128278; icon allows to bookmark. The bookmark list can be viewed by clicking on the &#128278; button below the search fields.

The bookmark list displays a link at the bottom that can be saved to archive a specific corpus, for instance [this one](https://g.h2.tf/?list=4113|34505|6791).

It is also possible to share lists without importing them like this [list of trees](https://g.h2.tf/?share=34987|10472|34622|17639|19007|31883|23320|697|17995).

# Exporting/importing lists

The list view (&#128278;) allows to export html file of the list. The html file can be reimported using the 'Load a list' button. The treeslist.html file provided in the repo can be used as a demo.
